# ArduinoWithSoundServoDf


We made arduino project that moves servo motor to turn off the switch.



We used 
  1. Servo motor(sg90)
  2. DFPlayer mini
  3. sound sensor(FC-04)
  4. micro sd card
  5. Arduino UNO board
  
  
Schmatic is on gitbook
Link :



If we clap once, sound sensor gets signal.
Then, servo moves with 110 degree.
After time that we set in timer code(as for me, it was 5 sec), servo moves to 10 degree and DFPlayer plays music saved inside.
